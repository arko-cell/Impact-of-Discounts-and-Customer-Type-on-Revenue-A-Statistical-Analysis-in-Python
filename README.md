# Pricing & Customer Revenue Analysis Using Statistical Inference

## Business Context
Understanding how pricing strategies and customer behavior influence revenue is
critical for data-driven business decisions. This project analyzes transactional
data to evaluate whether discounts increase revenue and whether repeat customers
generate higher revenue compared to one-time customers.

## Problem Statements
1. Does offering a discount lead to a statistically significant increase in revenue?
2. Is there a significant revenue difference between repeat customers and one-time customers?

## Dataset Overview
The dataset contains customer-level transaction data including:
- Revenue per customer
- Discount applied (True/False)
- Customer type (One-time / Repeat)
